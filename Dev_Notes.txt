# ============================
#
# Core program is written and has been running on two DigitalOcean servers now
# for almost 24 hours. Cron jobs on each server scan the fail2ban log file every
# 5 minutes then an scp cron pulls the files down every 12 minutes. I will be
# cutting back on the frequency that the server crons collect data to every hour
# then collect the data at +5min of the hour.
#
# Making preparations now to include a third server (AWS) into the process which
# will require a program to collect all data into a single formatted information
# form. Undecided as to which program to use for data collection however, have
# the selection narrowed down to Perl, Python, or Ruby. At current, Perl offers
# excellent modules for creating formatted forms however it's current popularity
# is behind in comparison to Python or Ruby.

# ============================
#
# Checked the status of current running instances and all looks fine; as was
# expected. Will establish reporting from third (AWS) server today.

# ============================
#
# Did not make additions to AWS server to cut back on current expenses. Made
# changes to the "daily" and "all" scripts to account for some errors and
# added formatting improvements. All changes have been pushed to repository.
# Both servers are running "daily" and "all" scripts.
#
# Separated testing scripts from working scripts by adding another folder named
# "testing". At current, the "all" script only pulls data from the currently
# active fail2ban.log file. Need to write a script to cat _all_ fail2ban files
# that are located in the /var/log/ directory. 
#

# ============================
#
# Updated both servers with new "all" scripts as the previous version had some
# kind of bugs in it that prevented it from working on the servers. This was of
# interest as the script was thoroughly tested "prior" to pushing it up to the
# servers. As such, all scripts, local and remote, have been updated
# accordingly.
#
# Both servers are now processing data as root rather than trying to do file
# manipulations in the user account. Once data is processed, files are pushed to
# the primary user account then chown.
#
# Current crons on both servers include:
# daily --> */10 * * * *
# all   --> */12 * * * *
# cp    --> */15 * * * *

# ============================
#
# Modified the "daily" scripts to use an array instead of writing to a file. The
# program is much faster and more efficient this way. Installed both new scripts
# to the respective servers.

# ============================
#
# Project temporarily closed due to personal circumstances.
#
# Initial project concepts deemed working as of last run. Still a few areas of
# information I would have liked to collect but it will have to wait for a later
# date of work. Plans still continue to convert the entire program to Python.
